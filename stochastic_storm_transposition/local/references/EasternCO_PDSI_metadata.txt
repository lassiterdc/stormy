DESCRIPTION:   
Eastern Colorado May/June/July Palmer Drought Severity Index Reconstruction 
based on tree ring chronologies in the western Great Plains and Front Range.


ABSTRACT:
A sustained mid-19th century drought in the western Great Plains has been 
indicated by a tree-ring analysis of trees flanking the western Great Plains, 
and in tree-ring reconstructions of drought and streamflow for eastern Colorado 
and the Colorado Front Range. The development of new tree-ring chronologies for 
the western Great Plains, in combination with existing chronologies, now enables 
a more detailed assessment of the spatial and temporal characteristics of this 
drought.  The analysis of a set of drought-sensitive tree-ring chronologies 
ranging from the northwestern Great Plains to central New Mexico indicates a 
core area of drought from south-central Wyoming to northeastern New Mexico for 
the years 1845-56.  Drought was particularly severe in the years 1845-48, 1851, 
and 1854-56, contracting and affecting smaller regions in intervening years.  
The impact of this drought on natural ecosystems and human activities is difficult 
to gauge because of the paucity of historical documents and the confounding effects 
of land use changes occurring over the same period.  However, it is probable that 
this drought played a role in the decimation of bison herds in the second half 
of the 19th century.  Were it to occur today, this relatively small but persistent 
drought would have significant impacts on the Colorado Front Range metropolitan 
area and the agricultural regions of eastern Colorado.
